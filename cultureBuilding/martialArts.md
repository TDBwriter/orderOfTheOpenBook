With the settings to be Ojibwe Warriors around the Great Lakes with a crew running Firefly like gigs and mercenary schemes to stay sailing. Our party is younglings, becoming a crew of younglings, growing into a crew, a Hand.

The Natives, the local tribal warriors, fight with hatchets, which they call hatchets, except when it's their weapon, and then it is a tomahawk, and to represent it's relationship to the hatchet as a weapon with honor in partnership together. They fight with their tomahawks in their lead hand, and a dagger or short sword in their power hand. They train with sticks in extremely tight quarters. 

Their ambush tactics are guerilla. Frenetic, sudden, speed surpise and violence of action, every block was a strike, every flurry was a kill with pinpoint precision.

This fighting style is called Okichitaw, (which currently could use some top instruction at the norse axe schools and the philipino kali schools), and focuses on natural efficiency. It's been a part of their culture.

They train with spears and lances for when they fight the horse tribes that roam the plains. All of guerilla warfare is a sport for them. They greet each other with stealth attacks in the night. Pranks, where entire camps were removed while the sleepers remained blissfully unaware. 

They destroyed the ones who came from the west. Their tactics were unsuited to the environment and they died in the most unusual of ways. Without fighting, after a single boom of protest. They are not human, not like us. Empty. Unthinking. Conformed entirely.

The invader eventually adapted, but never as well. Their warriors had to be reminded to clean their weapons, to be ready to fight, to work together. This is all we know. We gather, hunt, and fight.

They navigate forests and beasts, they have oral traditions. They know history because information was spread among the civilization. They killed the dinosaurs in order to tame the earth and claim it as a good place for humans to live. It was a paradise, and these invaders were fucking it up.
