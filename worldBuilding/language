The language of the area is English, common, basic, trades-speak, but is heavily influenced by the local language Ojibwe, specificlly Chippewa (Ojibwemowin) and uses Ojibwe syllabary script.

We are incorporating Ojibwe traditions into our world, giving them the Fremen treatment, but growing them from barbarians into Hands of The Order of the Open Book using diginity and education.
