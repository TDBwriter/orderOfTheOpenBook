The setting for this story is the port cities of the Great Lakes, inverted according to the compass. All the easy living northern lands have farmland, the United States side of the Great Lakes, but the southern lands, the Canadian side, feature harsh lands and a frontier of barbarians.

The shipping of supplies is active, food from the north, ore from the south, this was the only real commerce that kept the region alive. Anything else was a result of the upper classes entertaining themselves...equally as likely to be avarice as much as despotic.

The northern lands are the more populous, with sprawling communities of farmers, and their slaves, being supported by the food grown there, but needing the raw materials and ore that get shipped up from the usually frigid and frozen southern wilds in order to grow their hold on the territories.

The resources are being put to use holding the barbarian tribes at bay, and being developed into new weapons to push them further away. 

Civilization sprawls to the west, with some areas being cities that stretch as far as the ocean. Indeed, citing on the vast ocean that most consider the edge of the world. Except those in power, who came from there and know what lies beyond it.

Endless deserts stretch the east, ending at the Great Backbone (the Rockies: the Spine of the World, the rim on the great turtles shell). The belief is that the whole continent is just the back of a turtle, floating in the endless waters, taking us to our new home
