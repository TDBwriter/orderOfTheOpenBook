In this scene, Arinen receives motherly advice before being sent on her journey. She gives her the Griffon's Saddlebag. We learn how they came to be rulers of this place after a life of adventuring. Her mother cancels their regular magic training because she is exhausted from making the bag with extradimensional space. It became something more somehow.

"Don't worry, Ari, she will pull through. She has more willpower than anyone I have ever met."

If there were any truth in the words, her mother's comatose body stole it during the journey from her father's mouth to Arinen's ears. Kneeling at her mother's bedside, she tenderly supported the limp hand that had once spoon-fed her mushed berries as a baby, rubbed salve into her owies when she first began serious training, or wove her hair into neat rows for countless hours by this same hearth. The light from the fire danced across her mother's placid face. Turning her freckled and tear-stained face to her father, she could only silently plead with her eyes. Her throat was raw from half a ten-day of sobbing. His haggard visage did not appear to believe his words either as he sat slumped in a chair at the foot of the bed.

Faxanadu stood at a basin of fresh water on the nightstand across from Arinen. He twisted a clean rag into a tight cord, wringing most of the water from it back into the bowl. Gently, he placed this between the Duchess' teeth. He attempted to offer consolation to Arinen as well, "Your mother is incredibly powerful. One time, she even brought a dead man back to life."

Of course, Arinen knew that story well. It had been the catalyst that ended their time on the road. The gnome-king Gravyn Glittergem had sent riders for aid when a horde of mauraders led by a dragon-rider had attacked the castle and town. When all was said and done, the king was dead along with most of his troops. The horde turned tail and ran when Faxanadu and his love, the druid Aranan, mounted the black dragon and slew it in the skies. Morticia had been able to recover Faxanadu's corpse from the wreckage, but acid prevented his arm from regaining function. The acid so completely affected Aranan that she couldn't save him. After stabilizing the community, the gnomes left the humans in charge and retreated back underground. Her family used the time to help the community, maintain relationships with the gnomes for trading, and searched for their peace in recovery. They claimed this had come to them with Arinen.

Morticia sighed in exasperation at his leveity, but so softly that at first they didn't realize she had awoken until the wet cloth fell from her lips.
