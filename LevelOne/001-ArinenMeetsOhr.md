## Arinen Comes of Age

Life in the castle never seemed to change. It was Arinen's birthday, one of the important ones. Her parents were in early discussions to have her wed to new Duke over the fief that bordered their lands to the east. The old Duke had passed early last winter from breathing complications. Since then, his son had been growing into the role. His mother, the Duchess, still ruled officially, but had recently been stepping back to allow the new Duke to grow.

A sword sliced through the little hairs that fell free from her braid, snapping her rudely from her reverie. Sir Faxanadu chastised her with a series of clicks from his tongue. She hated that sound. Even when it wasn't directed at her, when anyone made that sound, her body responded in the way it was conditioned. Her cheeks flushed hot and the blood pounded in her ears. Her body betrayed her in the same way now.

"Ari, where are you? That could have permanently separated your neck from your shoulders. There is no room for thinking in a fight, you must attune all your senses to the battlefield."

She shook her head, chagrined. "I know. Sorry. I guess I've not the mood for it today." She gently patted her hair, feeling that it was still mostly presentable, and still there.

Faxanadu whirled around, arcing his sword in a downward angle towards her clavicle. The speed and violence in the action startled her, and she barely defended the blow in time. It came so quickly that she barely got her shield in between her and the sword before the strike. It connected with such force that the shield bounced off her shoulder and head, knocking her off balance. Quickly, she recovered her footing and got her head in the game. Practice sword or no, that would have killed her.

He pressed the attack, closing the gap between them while crossing his sword back the way it came. She met his strike with one of her own, directing his momentum up over her head again. He allowed let his body and sword be carried as she directed, bringing his shield around and crunching into her face. She stumbled back, jarred, desperately trying not to notice the stars crowding her vision. His reach and the length of his sword were a clear advantage, but she had trained to mitigate those. In fact, she'd never sparred with anyone who didn't have such an advantage over her.

She let him come, blow after blow, he was relentless. When the blows came from her left, she absorbed it with her shield. If it came from the right, she deflected it with her short sword. Normally, Faxanadu taught her with repetition. He would attack with the same patterns over and over, allowing her to learn the rhythm and gain confidence in her defenses. Now though, he varied his attacks. She rushed to string her defenses together in some way that would allow to her break an opening in his repertoire.

Arinen let her anxiety for her destiny fall away, existing in the moment. In the fight. Blow after blow rained down on her. It wasn't long before she recognized Faxandu's extended pattern. Her sparring partners always slipped into a pattern. It was just a matter of recognizing it. Faxanadu was angry. His irritation at her privileged attitude had him trying to knock the sense into her. It was working. His blows were brutal. She knew if she performed an iota below her ability, she was going to need a healer. The last time that happened, her father had broken Ser Faxanadu's nose. Although, he adamantly defended his old friend to her and her mother once his rage had subsided. The time before that, Faxanadu's eye had been blackened.

"Mood is for feasting and fucking, not for fighting."
