The Fighting Mood

Life in the castle never changed. It was exhausting. The expectations and routines bled one day to the next, and today was no different. It was no small wonder the nobility consumed so many barrels of mead every year. There were, however, changes on the horizon. It was Arinen's birthday, one of those with a significant milestone. Having survived the requisite number of seasons in her lifetime, the proverbial "powers-that-be", who inexplicably felt entitled to her destiny, decided she was a woman now. Politically, that is. Her parents were starting discussions to have her wed to the boy who recently became Duke over the fiefdom that bordered their lands to the east. The old Duke had passed early last winter from breathing complications. Since then, his son had been growing into the role. His mother, the Duchess, still ruled officially, but had recently been stepping back to allow the new Duke to grow.

A sword sliced through the wisps of hair that had escaped from her braid, snapping her rudely from her reverie. Sir Faxanadu chastised her with a series of clicks from his tongue. She hated that sound. Even when it wasn't directed at her, that sound made her conditioned body respond. Her cheeks flushed and blood pounded in her ears. Shame causing her body to betray her.

"Ari! Where are you? That would have permanently separated your neck from your shoulders. There is no opportunity for daydreaming in a fight. You must attune all your senses to you environment..."

She shook her head, chagrined. "...frays have threats all about," she finished his maxim. "I know. Sorry. I guess I've not the mood for it today." She responded as she gently patted her hair. It remained mostly presentable, and most important to her, simply present.

"Mood?" he spun like a roaring tiger whipping his blade in a wide arc intended to cleave her shoulder to hip. The speed and violence in the motion startled her into action. She barely got her shield in between her and his blade before the impact bounced the shield off her temple, disrupting her balance. Quickly, she recovered her footing and got her head in the game. Practice sword or no, that would have killed her. Castle life had turned into something memorable.

Faxanadu pressed the attack, backhanding a horizontal slice with his lunge, closing the gap between them. She met his strike with one of her own, deflecting his momentum over her head. The blow landed hollow, willingly avoiding its purpose. His shield followed, crunching against her face. She stumbled back, desperately ignoring the stars crowding her vision. His reach combined with the length of his longsword were a clear advantage, however she had yet to spar with anyone without such an advantage over her.

Arinen let him come, blow after blow. He was relentless. When the threat came from her left, she absorbed it with her shield. If it came from the right, she deflected it with her short sword. Usually, Faxanadu taught her with repetition. He would repeat the patterns over and over, allowing her to learn the rhythm, gaining confidence in her defenses. Now he was serious, and she rushed to string her defenses together in a way that might break an opening in his repertoire.

Arinen felt the anxiety for her destiny fall away, releasing her to exist in the moment; fully in the fight. Faxanadu was right and truly pissed. Irritation at her privileged attitude led him to forcibly drive some sense into her. It was working. The blows battered her left and right. She knew if she performed an iota below his expectation, they were going to need a cleric. The last time this happened, her father had broken Faxanadu's nose. The time before that, he received a black eye. Behind closed doors, however, the Baron adamantly defended his old friend's method to his wife. Arinen needed to improve, and quickly, if she wanted to alter her destiny.

She began working her defense so that the follow up strike would be one she had decided on, not her attacker. Patterns of attack usually revealed themselves, but occasionally, an opponent needed help to establish one. Ducking low under his sword carried his momentum and lifeless shield bearing arm too far to mount a defense against her thrust. Guilt for the manipulation flashed through her. As his blade passed over her head, she side-stepped in close and began her thrust that would sneak just behind his shield, and into his kidneys. If not for the dulled blades and chainmail shirts, it would be a fight-ender, as Faxanadu colloquially referred to such a strike.

Faxanadu fully recovered his breathing before Arinen was able to realize the fight had ended. As she lay there, experiences swirling through her vision, coalescing into what had just happened. Rather than reining in his strike after she offered no resistance, he maintained his follow-through. His trailing foot swung around to meet her chin. Now, his face floated into her view, "Get up. There is enough lying about when you are dead."

She scrambled to her feet, resuming her fighting stance. Or something approximating one. Faxanadu motioned for her to relax. "What have I told you about telegraphing your intentions? Making plans in a fight only reveals them with your body language. Trust the memories trained into your muscles." He finished stowing his training equipment and began to don the uniform of the day.

Gingerly, she doffed hers as well. "How can I build muscle memory for such maneuvers, if not in training?" Clearly, being concussed had not dissipated the cloud of petulance shrouding her today.

He smiled wide, "One of the purest pleasures my lot affords me is that, occasionally, I get to kick wise ass little girls in the mouth." He paused to allow room for appreciation of his wit. Just as it was becoming with child, he continued, "How does one build muscle memories?"

She smiled. He never missed a trainable moment. "Envision the motions in my mind's eye to explore the possibilities. Incorporate the motions into my kata. Allow the maneuvers into the fight when my body is ready." Arinen mustered her dignity, "I wasn't ready."

"You rose to meet my aggression well," he praised. "It was a clever maneuver. You should work it out." Circling back to the original offense, he continued, "Moods are for feasting and fucking..."

Straightening her posture, she finished, "...not for fighting." Faxanadu nodded. He never let her drop the highborn facade for long. He believed that conflicts began long before blades cleared sheaths, and one's demeanor can mitigate the need for violence in most cases. She was of the persuasion to avoid conflict by avoiding assholes, but clearly, Faxanadu loved doling out lessons.

He pressed her for more details as they walked the passageways towards her quarters. "Really Ari. Where were you in there?"

Arinen chewed her lip. She couldn't meet his gaze, but confessed. "I've been thinking a lot about my future with the young Duke."

He frowned, "What about it? He has been
