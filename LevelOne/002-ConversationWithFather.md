Arinen was surprised at how soft the bound leather book felt as caressed the fresh find she pulled from the top shelf in her father's immaculate study. The title, Alpine Tribes, was branded onto the spine, as was his custom with all his books. She'd read this one twice before, but it was one of her favorites. As far as content goes, it was mildly boring, seeing as how she had lived in this region her whole life. The pictures her father had drawn were remarkable. She moved for the chaise under the huge open window. Rifling the pages absently, the smell of the mountains reveling in spring bloom stopped her at one early page in particular. 

Relaxing into the lounger, she allowed herself to transported into the scene. Thin vegetation placed it high up in the hills, somewhere just above the treeline. A lone tree in the foreground stood out among the few mountain peaks in view. It was squat, but stout, sprouting think branches wide in all directions. To her, this tree appeared to hold up the sky while rays of cool sunshine pressured it crawl down the slope to be with its brethren. Nestled in the crook of a low branch, lounging much as Arinen was now, a girl basked in the sun light watching as a line of people marched along the ridgeline. Doubtless a tribe migrating with the herds. Everyones hair was windswept and leaves swirled in eddies among the rocks. Thinking of fall winds sent a shiver up Arinen's spine despite the warm breeze floating in through the window.

Duke Glittergem looked up from his piles of paperwork when he heard her small gasp. "What is that you have, lady?"

Arinen didn't pull away from the crisp line drawing. Instead, she shifted her weight around to settle deeper into the cushions. Knowing he wouldn't have any trouble identifying the book from her question, she ignored his, asking, "Who is this little girl, Daddy? The one in the mountain tree watching the tribe climbing single file?"

"Oh, that is not a little girl. That is Mommy. She only looks so small because those people are positively huge."

Now she sat bolt upright. "It is?" Frowning, she said, "Are they giants?"

"Possibly, I suppose, though with exception to their size, they are not all that different from us. Are you reading that old tome again?"

"The pictures in this one are so much better than any of your other journals."

"Naturally, that was one of the calmest periods of my, our, entire lives. Once we'd learned we had finally taken with child, we quit the road and settled into more dedicated leadership over this territory. We thought it wisest to ease into settled life by exploring our lands and breaking bread with the people who also called it home. We took our time and I was able to put a lot of time into that particular area of study. The nature of life on the road meant I mostly did quick sketches in my journals.In fact, that is our first family portrait."

"Really?! Where am I?" She analyzed it closer looking for any babies and in the column for her father.

"You were still in the womb, yet a seedling likely. Actually, those dark mounds in the foreground are the toes of my boots, not rocks."

Arinen giggled, "It is wonderful, Daddy." She turned to the title page. It read "Alpine Tribes of Elipan: Customs, Culture and Philosophy". As she started reading the first page, she began to feel the beginnings of a plan take shape in her mind.
