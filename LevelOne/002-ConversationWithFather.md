Arinen was surprised at how soft the bound leather book felt as caressed the fresh find she pulled from the top shelf in her father's immaculate study. The title, Alpine Tribes, was branded onto the spine, as was his custom with all his books. She'd read this one twice before, but it was one of her favorites. As far as content goes, it was mildly boring, seeing as how she had lived in this region her whole life. The pictures her father had drawn were remarkable. She moved for the chaise under the huge open window. Rifling the pages absently, the smell of the mountains reveling in spring bloom stopped her at one early page in particular. 

Relaxing into the lounger, she allowed herself to transported into the scene. Thin vegetation placed it high up in the hills, somewhere just above the treeline. A lone tree in the foreground stood out among the few mountain peaks in view. It was squat, but stout, sprouting think branches wide in all directions. To her, this tree appeared to hold up the sky while rays of cool sunshine pressured it crawl down the slope to be with its brethren. Nestled in the crook of a low branch, lounging much as Arinen was now, a girl basked in the sun light watching as a line of people marched along the ridgeline. Doubtless a tribe migrating with the herds. Everyones hair was windswept and leaves swirled in eddies among the rocks. Thinking of fall winds sent a shiver up Arinen's spine despite the warm breeze floating in through the window.

Duke Glittergem looked up from his piles of paperwork when he heard her small gasp. "What is that you have, lady?"

Arinen didn't pull away from the crisp line drawing. Instead, she shifted her weight around to settle deeper into the cushions. Knowing he wouldn't have any trouble identifying the book from her question, she ignored his, asking, "Who is this little girl, Daddy? The one in the mountain tree watching the tribe climbing single file?"

"Oh, that is not a little girl. That is Mommy. She only looks so small because those people are positively huge."

Now she sat bolt upright. "It is?" Frowning, she said, "Are they giants?"

"Possibly, I suppose, though with exception to their size, they are not all that different from us. Are you reading that old tome again?"

"The pictures in this one are so much better than any of your other journals."

"Naturally, that was one of the calmest periods of my, our, entire lives. Once we'd learned we had finally taken with child, we quit the road and settled into more dedicated leadership over this territory. We thought it wisest to ease into settled life by exploring our lands and breaking bread with the people who also called it home. We took our time and I was able to put a lot of time into that particular area of study. The nature of life on the road meant I mostly did quick sketches in my journals.In fact, that is our first family portrait."

"Really?! Where am I?" She analyzed it closer looking for any babies and in the column for her father.

"You were still in the womb, yet a seedling likely. Actually, those dark mounds in the foreground are the toes of my boots, not rocks."

Arinen giggled, "It is wonderful, Daddy." She turned to the title page. It read "Alpine Tribes of Elipan: Customs, Culture and Philosophy". As she started reading the first page, she began to feel the beginnings of a plan take shape in her mind. She sat up and faced her father, mustering an adulthood she never imagined could ever be hers. "Daddy, I do not want to marry Rufus."

Coolness settled between them as the heartbeats grew into breaths. The scratching feather filled all the void left by her father's silence. She decided to become one with the stillness. She had played her opening move, and it was his turn. The breaths turned into a heat that passed through her body in waves, just under the skin. She could feel the waves driving her energies to her mind, and it didn't go to waste. While her father waged a mental war between this intrusion and his business, she focused on refining inspiration into argument.

The Duke, her father, Daddy, finished the thoughts he had begun on his paper, placed the quill into its resting place, and leaned back into his chair. "Why did you wait so long to bring this to my attention? We did not need to waste our energies trying to arrange all these details."

Arinen loved her daddy. He always understood. Always respected her. She knew now more than ever that he could help her navigate this emotionally fraught political puzzle for the best possible outcome. "Oh, daddy," she gushed with relief. "I hope it will not be wasted. He has always been my good friend. He will care for our people, and his, I have little doubt. I only mean that I do not want to marry him just yet. It is just that I am worried that because he has gained so much political experience, and power, of late, that our joining now would leave me as little more than arm candy in the eyes of our other neighbors."

She watched as the horror of it being spoken aloud came to his eyes. Evidently this particular fear was familiar to him. His chest expanded and his nostrils flared as he breathed in his thoughts. Pride replaced the fear in his eyes as he expelled these emotions out through tight lips. This ability to master his emotional response wasn't passed naturally to Arinen, but she strove to emulate it, mostly unsuccessfully. It may have been one of her most loved traits that he had.

His eyes did not blink. Did not waver. "What do you propose?"

 She was right to trust him. "Elipians pride surpasses even our peaks, which are beyond climbing. It would not be justice to simply hand the people over to another family, their nobility and kindness notwithstanding. It may not be an indignity that could be endured."

 "Perhaps." The logic was sound, so he didn't voice his doubts about her hyperbole.

 "I propose we merely arrange to delay the wedding. Let us continue the political and logistical unification and build a strong union of the people. In the meantime, I will tour the scholarly cloisters of the twelve kingdoms in order to research the history of our lands so that we may be best prepared to parlay with them politically as a new, unified people. A joined family."

 Now, he allowed some skepticism to show. "Do you think Rufus, or more accurately, his mother would accept this worldwide library tour? They will assume you are courting royals to your side before the marriage."

 Slowly, she nodded as if she were considering this revelation. She paced over to the window and considered the view. "I would expect so, but that is not a liability to the union. It strengthens our union in the eyes of the nobility. In fact, the courting of these foreign nobles is my primary goal. I will do the research, because it is prudent, and I desperately want to know, but my deception in this is less for the Baron or his mother." She turned toward her father, a sliver of sunshine outlining her in stark regality against the cold stone. None of the comfortable, luxuriant, soft families of the Northern kingdoms will be wary that a dirty Southern Duchess is courting their scholars nor winning the respect of their house Weapon Masters."

He leapt to his feet and quickly crossed the room to grip her in one of the mighty hugs that she treasured. Muffled into his chest, she concluded her thoughts with the core of truth that she had reserved. "Daddy, I want to see the world before I must settle into a boring political existence."

"Oh, I know, baby." He breathed her curls in deeply and held her tight enough to restrict her breathing. After a few moments he released her and held her at arms length, looking into her eyes. "I am so proud of the wisdom you carry. You will lead these people so much better than I. We will start making the necessary arrangements immediately. But please, allow me the courtesy of breaking the news to your Mother and Faxanadu?"

"Yes, Daddy." She planted a kiss on his cheek. "Will you tell them soon? What will you say?"

"Of course, soon. There's no reason to delay with the spring melt opening the passes. I will talk with Mom tonight after...she is relaxed. Faxanadu after I finish this contract," he gestured at his desk, "I can't wait to see how excited he is to be going back on the road!"
