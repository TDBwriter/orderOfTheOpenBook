Life in the castle never changed. It was exhausting in its mundanity. The routines bled one day to the next, and today was no different, special though it may be. It was no small wonder the nobility of the world consumed such excessive quantities of wine. Today was Arinen's birthday, one of those with a significant milestone. Having survived the required amount of years, seemingly arbitrarily set, culture dicated that now she was a woman, politically, at least.  Her parents were starting discussions to have her wed to the boy who recently became Duke over the fiefdom that bordered their lands to the east. The old Duke developed complications wth his breathing at the onset of winter, and died shortly after. Since then, his son has been growing into the role. His mother, the Duchess, still ruled officially, but had recently been stepping back to allow the new Duke to grow. When she was younger, she expected these changes would be welcome, but she was surprised to find they put her ill at ease. She was gripped by the fear that the changes that would only be a distraction before things inevitably settled into more of the same.

A sword sliced through the wisps of hair that had escaped from her braid, snapping her rudely from her reverie. Faxanadu chastised her with quiet clicks of his tongue. She hated that sound. Even when it wasn't directed at her, that sound made her conditioned body respond. Her cheeks flushed and blood pounded in her ears. Shame causing her body to betray her.

"Ari! Where are you? That would have permanently separated your neck from your shoulders. There is no opportunity for daydreaming in a fight. You must attune all your senses to you environment..."

Arinen shook her head, chagrined. "...frays have threats all about," she finished his maxim. "I know. Sorry. I guess I've not the mood for it today." She responded as she gently patted her hair. It remained mostly presentable, and most important to her, simply present.

"Mood?" he spun like a roaring tiger whipping his blade in a wide arc intended to cleave her shoulder to hip. The speed and violence in the motion startled her into action. She barely got her shield in between her and his blade before the impact bounced the shield off her temple, disrupting her balance. Quickly, she recovered her footing and got her head in the game. Practice sword or no, that would have killed her. For now, at least, castle life had turned into something memorable.

Faxanadu pressed the attack, backhanding a horizontal slice as he closed the gap between them. She met his strike with one of her own, deflecting his momentum over her head. The blow rang hollow, lazily avoiding its purpose. It was his shield that followed through, crunching against her face. She stumbled back, desperately ignoring the stars crowding her vision. His reach combined with the length of his longsword were a clear advantage, though admittedly, she had yet to spar against anyone without such an advantage over her.

Arinen let him come, blow after blow. He was relentless. When the threat came from her left, she absorbed it with her shield. If it came from the right, she deflected it with her short sword. Usually, Faxanadu taught her with repetition. He would repeat the patterns over and over, allowing her to learn the rhythm, gaining confidence in her defenses. Now he was serious, and she rushed to string her defenses together in a way that might break an opening in his repertoire.

The anxiety for her destiny fell away, releasing her to exist in the moment; fully in the fight. Faxanadu was right and truly pissed. Irritation at her privileged attitude drove him to force the sense into her with the edge of the sword. It was working. Blows battered her left and right. If she performed an iota below his expectation, a healer would be needed. Last time this happened, her father broke Faxanadu's nose. The time before that, he had received a black eye for his efforts. Behind closed doors, however, the Baron argued to his wife in favor of his old friend's methods. Arinen needed to improve, and quickly, if she wanted to alter her destiny to one in which she survived.

She worked her defense so follow up strikes were ones she had decided for him. For most fights, patterns of attack revealed themselves in short order, but conditioned and experienced opponents needed some help to establish one. Pulling her parry to duck his sword carried his momentum further along his twist bringing his lifeless shield bearing arm too far to mount a defense against her thrust. A pang of guilt for taking advantage of his disability chilled her blood as she side-stepped in close to sneak a thrust just behind his shield and into his kidneys. A fight-ender, as Faxanadu colloquially referred to such a strike, were it not for dulled blades and chainmail shirts.

Faxanadu fully recovered his breathing before Arinen even realized the fight had ended. She fumbled absently about on her back, feelings and memories swirling through her mind's eye, dragging her consciousness like a charging warhorse back to the present. Rather than reining in his strike after she offered no resistance, he maintained proper follow-through. His trailing foot swung with blind precision to meet her chin. His face floated into her view, "Get up," he said softly. "There will be lying about enough when you are dead."

Scrambling to her feet, she resumed her fighting stance. Or something approximating one. Faxanadu motioned for her to relax. "What have I told you about telegraphing your intentions? Making mental plans in a fight only reveals them with your body language. Trust the memories trained into your muscles." He finished stowing his training equipment and began to don the uniform of the day.

Gingerly, she doffed hers as well. "How can I build muscle memory for such maneuvers, if not in training?" Clearly, being concussed had not dissipated the cloud of petulance shrouding her today.

He smiled wide, "One of the purest pleasures my lot has afforded me is that, occasionally, I get to kick wise ass little girls in the mouth." He paused to allow room for appreciation of his wit. Just as it was becoming with child, he reminded her, "How does one build muscle memories?"

She smiled. He never missed a trainable moment. "Envision the motions in my mind to explore the possibilities. Incorporate the motions into my daily kata. Allow the maneuvers into the fight when my body demands them." Arinen mustered her dignity, "I wasn't ready."

"You rose to meet my aggression well," he praised. "It was a clever maneuver. You should continue to work it out." Circling back to her original offense, he continued with his reminders, "Moods are for feasting and fucking..."

Straightening her posture, she finished, "...not for fighting." Faxanadu nodded. He never let her drop the highborn facade for long. He believed that conflicts began long before blades cleared sheaths, and one's demeanor can mitigate the need for violence in most cases. She was of the persuasion to avoid conflict by avoiding assholes, but clearly, Faxanadu loved doling out lessons.

He pressed her for more details as they walked the passageways towards her quarters. "Really Ari. Where were you in there?"

Arinen chewed her lip. She couldn't meet his gaze, but confessed. "I've been thinking a lot about my future with the young Duke."

He frowned, "What about it? He has been a good friend to you for years. Has something happened between you?"

She shook her head with a shrug. "No, nothing like that. He is wonderful, and it is a smart match. I just feel...resistant, somehow. As if, I am merely the deed to this kingdom that he must accept in order to rule it."

Reaching her rooms, they faced each other. She continued, "We are unbalanced. The rumors say he is quite the politician, already building respect in nearby courts. I'll not be arm candy the rest of my life, boring as it may be."

Faxanadu chuckled and drew her close in a warm embrace. He kissed her forehead lovingly. "My sweet, wise, Ari. You never could abide being told what to do...I have had similar concerns. Not for you, like this, but for the kingdom. It does feel a bit like giving it all away." He pulled away and brushed away the hair that wasn't falling into her face. "The world moves and we make our best choices amidst the waves. While the ladies do their best with your face, consider the best argument you can bring before your father to delay this union until our kingdoms can join on equal footing."

Before she closed the door behind her, she turned back to him. "Don't let Daddy punish you too permanently when you are sparring."

Faxanadu's low growl of a laugh reverberated off the stone passageway. "I always make that old swashbuckler dance extra hard for it. He probably wishes he didn't have to appease that sorceress mother of yours." Arinen smiled lovingly. She had always found the playfulness the three friends shared both comforting. She hoped beyond hope that she could find friendship as solid and loyal as theirs.

With a curt dip of his head, he turned and strode toward the kitchens.
