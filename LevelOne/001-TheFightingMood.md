Life in the castle never changed. It was exhausting in its mundanity. The routines bled one day to the next, and today was no different, special though it may be. It was no small wonder the nobility of the world consumed such excessive quantities of wine. Today was Arinen's birthday, one of those with a significant milestone. Having survived the required amount of years, seemingly arbitrarily set, culture dictated that now she was a woman, politically, at least.  Her parents were starting discussions to have her wed to the boy who recently became Duke over the fiefdom that bordered their lands to the east. The old Duke developed complications with his breathing at the onset of winter, and died shortly after. Since then, his son has been growing into the role. His mother, the Duchess, still ruled officially, but has been allowing room for the new Duke to grow in his leadership. When Arinen was younger, she expected these changes, anticipated eagerly even, but now was surprised to find they put her ill at ease. She was gripped by a fear that the changes would only be a distraction before life inevitably settled into more of the same.

A sword sliced through the baby hairs that would not be tamed within her braided rows, snapping her rudely from reverie. Faxanadu chastised her with quiet clicks of his tongue. She hated that sound. Even when it wasn't directed at her, that sound made her conditioned body respond. With her cheeks flushed and blood pounding in her ears, unwarranted feelings of shame betrayed her body.

"Ari! Where are you? That would have separated your neck from your shoulders. There is no opportunity for daydreaming in a fight. You must keep all your senses attuned to your environment..."

Arinen subtly shook her head, chagrined. "...for frays have threats all about," she finished his maxim. Visibly slumping, she continued. "I know. Sorry. I guess I have not the mood for it today." Gently she patted her hair. It remained mostly presentable, and most important to her, simply present.

"Mood?" he growled, whipping his growl into a roar and his blade at her in a wide arc. The speed and violence in the motion startled her into action. She barely raised her shield before force of impact bounced it into her temple, disrupting her balance. Quickly, she recovered her footing with a wide stance and focused her mind in the present. Practice sword or no, that might have killed her. Her shame was replaced with a surge of satisfaction. For the moment, at least, castle life had turned into something worthwhile.

Faxanadu pressed his attack, closing the gap he had just created with a level backhanded slice. She met his strike with one of her own, deflecting his momentum over her head. The blow rang hollow, lazily avoiding its purpose. It was his shield that followed through, crunching against her face. She stumbled back, desperately ignoring the stars crowding her vision. His reach combined with the length of his longsword were a clear advantage, though admittedly, she had yet to spar against anyone without such an advantage over her and her small frame.

Gradually recovering, Arinen let him come, blow after blow. He was relentless. When the threat came from her left, she absorbed it with her shield. If it came from the right, she deflected it with her short sword. Typically, Faxanadu developed his instruction with repetition. Repeating the patterns over and over, he allowed her to learn the rhythms, gaining confidence in her defense. Now he was serious, and she rushed to string her defenses together in a way that might break an opening for her to exploit.

Anxieties about her destiny fell away, releasing her to flourish in this moment; fully in the fight. Faxanadu was right and truly pissed. Irritation at her privileged attitude drove him to force sense into her at the edge of a sword. It was working. Blows battered her left and right. If she performed an iota below his expectation, a healer would be needed. Last time this happened, her father broke Faxanadu's nose in anger. The time before that, he had received a black eye for his efforts. Behind closed doors, however, she knew the Baron argued to his wife in favor of his old friend's methods. Arinen needed to improve, and quickly, if she wanted to survive.

She worked her defense so his follow up strikes were ones she had decided for him. For the average combatant, patterns of attack revealed themselves in short order, but conditioned and experienced opponents needed some help to establish one. By pulling her parry and ducking his sword, his momentum carried him further along his twist and brought his lifeless shield-bearing arm to far to mount a defense against a thrust. Taking advantage of his disability briefly chilled her blood, yet still she side-stepped in close to sneak the thrust just behind his shield and into his kidneys. A fight-ender, as Faxanadu colloquially referred to such a strike, were it not for dulled blades and chainmail shirts.

Faxanadu had waited on her long enough to have fully recovered his breathing before Arinen even realized the fight had ended. She fumbled incoherently about on her back, feelings and vague memories swirling through her mind's eye, fighting to bring her consciousness back to the present like a charging warhorse. Rather than reining in his strike after she offered no resistance, he maintained proper follow-through. His trailing foot swung with blind precision to meet her chin. A maneuver embarrassingly similar to the way he had opened the encounter. His face floated into her view, "Get up," he said tenderly. "There will be lying about enough when you are dead."

Scrambling to her feet, she resumed her fighting stance. Or something approximating one. Faxanadu motioned for her to relax. "What have I told you about telegraphing your intentions? Making mental plans in a fight only reveals them with your body language. Trust the memories trained into your muscles." He finished stowing his training equipment and began to don the uniform of the day.

Gingerly, she doffed her gear as well. "How can I build muscle memory for such maneuvers, if not in training?" Clearly, being concussed had not dissipated the cloud of petulance shrouding her today.

He smiled wide, "Also, you are zero for two with maneuvers that assume my strikes are uncontrollable. One of the purest pleasures my lot has afforded me is that, occasionally, I get to kick wise ass girls in the mouth." He paused to allow room for appreciation of his wit. Just as it was becoming with child, he reminded her, "How does one build muscle memories?"

She smiled. He never missed a trainable moment. "Envision the motions in my mind to explore the possibilities. Incorporate the motions into my daily kata. Allow the maneuvers into the fight when my body demands them." Arinen mustered her dignity, "I wasn't ready."

"You rose to meet my aggression well," he praised. "It was a clever maneuver. You should continue to work it out." Circling back to her original offense, he continued with his reminders, "Moods are for feasting and fucking..."

Straightening her posture, she finished, "...not for fighting." Faxanadu nodded. He never let her drop the highborn facade for long. He believed that conflicts began long before blades cleared sheaths, and one's demeanor can mitigate the need for violence in most cases. She preferred to avoid conflict by avoiding assholes, but clearly, there was no skirting Faxanadu's lessons.

He pressed her for more details about her mindset as they walked the castle corridors towards her quarters. "Really Ari. Where were you in there?"

Arinen chewed her lip. She couldn't meet his gaze, but confessed. "I've been thinking a lot about my future with the new Duke."

He frowned, "What about it? He has been a good friend to you for years. Has something soured between you?"

She shook her head with a shrug. "No, nothing like that. He is wonderful, and it is a smart match. I just feel...resistant, somehow. As if, I am merely the deed to this kingdom that he must accept in order to rule it."

Reaching her rooms, they faced each other. She continued, "We are unbalanced. The rumors say he is quite the politician, already building respect in nearby courts. I would be just a bearer of heirs the rest of my eventless life."

Faxanadu chuckled and drew her close in a warm embrace. He kissed her forehead lovingly. "Sweet, wise, Ari. You never could abide being told what to do...I have had similar concerns. Not for you, in this way you mention, but for the kingdom. It does feel a bit like giving it all away." He pulled away with a wide smile and brushed away the hair that wasn't actually falling into her face. "The world moves and we make our best choices amidst the waves. Go prepare for your day, and while the ladies do their best with your face to keep me out of trouble, consider the what arguments you might bring before your father that could delay this union until the kingdoms can join on equal footing."

Before she closed the door behind her, she turned back to him. "Don't let Daddy punish you too permanently when you spar."

Faxanadu's low rumble of a laugh reverberated off the stones. "I always make that old swashbuckler dance extra hard for it. He probably wishes he didn't have to appease that sorceress mother of yours." Arinen smiled lovingly. She had always found the playfulness the three friends shared to be comforting. She hoped beyond hope that she could find friendship as solid and loyal as theirs.

With a curt dip of his head, he turned and strode toward the kitchens.
